This is Online Pizza Ordering System

The main objectives of this ordering system are: 
Build your own pizza – This system will help customers in ordering custom pizzas. So, the customer 
will pick exactly the things which they want in their pizza. 
 
 
How this system works:

Whenever a customer visits the webpage of the pizzeria, the menu will be visible to the customer 
with the pizzas and other non-pizza products. All the ingredients will be shown at their 
prices. 
 
Menu
The system will provide customers a menu in which all the pizzas and non-pizza items will be shown 
with their prices. The customer can select any pizza from the menu or build the custom pizza. 
Each pizza will be shown with their image and price. The ingredients used in the making of that pizza 
can also be seen. 
After each selection or de-selection, the grand total of the order will be updated. 
 
Build Your Pizza
One of the most amazing features of online pizza ordering system is that you can build your pizzas 
from the scratch. This system provides the options to create your custom pizzas with everything of 
your choice. 
Let me tell you more about making custom pizzas. 
 The customer will get an option to select pizza’s crust size which can be small, medium, or 
large. 
 Then the customer has to choose the sauce to be used on his pizza crust. These can marinara, 
cheese, ranch, and others. 
 Then the system asks the customer whether to add cheese or not. They also have an option to 
select for extra cheese. 
 At last the system shows the customers different types of toppings. 
 One important point to be noticed here is after each step, the updated price of your custom built pizza is shown to the customers. 

 
After the customer has finished selecting the items to be ordered, the order is saved, and order id is 
generated for the customer.

This system is built using Angular 12 for user interface and .net Core 3.1 Web API for the backend
